    "Throughout our research we have been interested in the accretion of BHs to very large masses and the conditions that faciliate this growth. So we tried varying different parameters in succession in order to understand this supermassive BHs phenomenon. So these simulations are a continuing theme in our research."

The other group members changed their corresponding parameters to other values than the default ones. We will then compare the plots with different parameter values. These will then be compared to a review paper to see if there's any match."
